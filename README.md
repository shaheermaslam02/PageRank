# PageRank - Google's PageRank algorithm for ranking websites in searches

We simulated the PageRank algorithm developed by Google co-founder Larry Page, which was used to rank websites. It decides the rank of a given website by utilizing the number of websites that point to that website as well as the rank/weight of those websites. The algorithm uses a Markov matrix of website to website links and a an initial rank vector, using matrix multiplication on both until convergence to achieve the rank of each website.

### HITS algorithm extension

We also implemented the Hyper-Induced Topic Search algorithm developed by Jon Kleinberg, which uses a hub and authority score based on the links pointing to a website and the links the website points to.
